## Introduction
This study proposes an intelligent system for interactive vector pattern generation to address the labor-intensive process of creating scalable and production-ready patterns in the fashion and textile industries. The system integrates an Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) for layout generation and a colorization mechanism guided by reference images, enabling users to produce editable and aesthetically pleasing patterns efficiently. It also recommends Pantone TPX codes to streamline production workflows. Experimental results demonstrate the systemâ€™s ability to generate high-quality vector patterns in under a second, meeting industry standards for usability, efficiency, and human aesthetics. A survey with fashion professionals confirmed its practicality and potential for design support. While the system depends on high-quality reference images, future improvements will focus on enhancing pattern diversity and accessibility for non-expert users. This study offers a practical tool for automated vector pattern design, contributing to the advancement of computer-aided design in the fashion industry.
